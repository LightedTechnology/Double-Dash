### What is Double Dash?
**Double Dash** is a multiplayer game. The goal is simple:
- `❌` Ensure your team is the last one standing.

**BUT**:
- `🥾` You can't move;
- `🦿` You can't even jump;
- `🛡️` And when your enemies *do* move, they get an electroweak shield that blocks any and all projectiles.

**Double Dash** is a multiplayer game set in the distant future. As previously mentioned, your goal is to be the last one standing. But how exactly do you achieve that?
- `⚡` A core aspect of Double Dash is nitritol, a form of hyper-dense energy. Being toxic in nature, it is a wonderful coincidence that you carry some in your backpack to recharge your *batteries*.
  1. `🔋` As nitritol is too powerful an energy source, most of your devices will feed off your batteries. You are given a pair of batteries. Batteries have a 100 EU (Energy Units). You can recharge a battery by putting it in the backpack, making it inactive, although only one battery can be recharged at any given time.
- `⚔️` Each player is given **three active slots**.
  1. `🏹` The bow can be used indefinitely, for you have an unlimited amount of bolts (arrows). If a player is hit by a bolt, they are eliminated.
  2. `🔫` The breaker is a tool requiring energy to function. The breaker deals electroweak damage. It shoots in a straight line that can't penetrate walls.
  3. `➡️` Dash is an active ability that grants the ability to move. In addition, when dash is activated, a shield deflects arrows from you. Dash consumes energy.
- `🌎` The map in Double Dash is a sci-fi lab on a planet with insane gravity. The lab has no view outside.
- `🧶` All slots provided to the player are customisable.

`🚨` As previously mentioned, batteries have a 100 EU. When the battery reaches 25% of its capacity, an alarm is initiated.
`🔋` If the active battery goes to 0%, all vital systems are disabled until the inactive battery is charged to a 100%.
`🪫` If the inactive battery reaches 0%, the player experiences the same outcome as if getting hit by a bolt.
`⚡` The breaker's shot removes 60 EU from the active battery. If the active battery has less than 60 EU, the remainder is taken from the inactive battery.
