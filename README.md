### What is Double Dash?
**Double Dash** is a multiplayer game. The goal is simple:
- `❌` Ensure your team is the last one standing.

**BUT**:
- `🥾` You can't move;
- `🦿` You can't even jump;
- `🛡️` And when your enemies *do* move, they get an electroweak shield that blocks any and all projectiles.

**Double Dash** is a multiplayer game set in the distant future. As previously mentioned, your goal is to be the last one standing. But how exactly do you achieve that?
- `⚡` A core aspect of Double Dash is nitritol, a form of hyper-dense energy. Being toxic in nature, it is a wonderful coincidence that you carry some in your backpack to recharge your *batteries*.
  1. `🔋` As nitritol is too powerful an energy source, most of your devices will feed off your batteries. You are given a pair of batteries. Batteries have a 100 EU (Energy Units). You can recharge a battery by putting it in the backpack, although only one battery can be recharged at any given time.
- `⚔️` Each player is given **three weapon slots**. By default the player is provided with a *bow* and a *drabber*. Other weapons are acquired.
  1. `🏹` The bow can be used indefinitely, for you have an unlimited amount of bolts (arrows). If a player is hit by a bolt, they are eliminated.
  2. `🔫` The drabber is a tool requiring energy to function. The drabber deals electroweak damage. The drabber has two modes: short-range (the drabber's pulses reach only nearby targets, but precision doesn't really matter in this mode) and long-range (the drabber's pulses follow a direct path, not going through walls). If a player is hit by a pulse, they are stunned.
- `☄️` Each player is given **three active abilities slots**. From the get-go, the player is presented with one ability, and others are acquired (i.e. do not come by default).
  1. `➡️` Dash is the fundamental ability to Double Dash. While you can't move without dash, with it you can move swiftly. When dash is active, you are given a rudimentary protective shield, which will only withstand one drabber pulse. Dash requires energy only when the player is moving. 
  2. `⬆️` Above is an acquired ability, which allows the player to gain grounds by throwing the player into the air. Above takes energy only when used.
  3. `🛡️` Aegis is an acquired ability, which provides the player with an aegis flower, a composition of seven durable hexagonal shields in the form of a flower. The aegis can't be penetrated by the drabber, but it is limited only to protecting one side of the player. Aegis requires little energy, requiring more when deflecting projectiles.
  4. `🔺` Power is an acquired ability. Power increases the power of the pulses/shots of the player when active. Power draws energy only when pulses/shots are taken.
  5. `🔋` Charge is an acquired ability. Charge increases the speed of recharging batteries in the backpack. Charge does not require any energy.
- `⭐` The player is given **five passive abilities slots**. Passive abilities range from providing more damage to decreasing energy consumption.
- `🌎` The map in Double Dash is a sci-fi lab on a planet with insane gravity. The lab has no view outside.
- `🧶` All slots provided to the player are customisable.
